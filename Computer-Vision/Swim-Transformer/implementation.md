# Swin Transformer Implementation

## Overview
The Swin Transformer is an architecture that applies **window-based self-attention** to divide an image into smaller patches for focused attention, enabling efficient handling of large images. This design captures both **local** and **global** features, making it powerful for visual tasks such as classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## Key Components

### 1. Swin Transformer Class
The main class organizes the overall structure and initializes parameters necessary for Swin's window-based self-attention mechanism.

- **Parameters**:
  - `window_size`: Size of the windows for local self-attention.
  - `ape` (bool): Adds absolute positional embedding to each patch if set to True, helping the model keep track of spatial positions.
  - `fused_window_process`: Optional hardware optimization to speed up window processing.

### 2. Patch Embedding
Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin splits the input image into non-overlapping patches and applies a Conv2D layer for **linear embedding** of each patch. This step encodes spatial and channel information.

## Detailed Steps in Swin Transformer

### 1. Apply Positional Embeddings
If the `ape` parameter is enabled, absolute position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings. These embeddings help the model retain spatial relationships between patches, enhancing context-aware predictions.

### 2. Apply Depth Decay
To reduce overfitting, Swin implements **stochastic depth decay**, where layers are skipped during training with a probability based on their depth. Deeper layers are more likely to be skipped, ensuring smoother gradient flow and helping regularization.

### 3. Layer Construction
Each layer contains multiple **SwinTransformerBlock** modules that use window-based self-attention for focused, efficient processing. Layers downsample the feature map as follows:

- **Patch Merging**: This process reduces spatial resolution and increases feature dimensionality as the model goes deeper, similar to pooling in CNNs.
- **Feature Dimension and Resolution Adjustments**: Layer outputs have progressively changing resolutions and feature dimensions, allowing Swin to learn hierarchical features at multiple scales.

## Swin Transformer Block

The `SwinTransformerBlock` encapsulates the key operations for Swin’s efficiency with large images. It operates on local windows of patches, focusing attention within each window, while also allowing some cross-window interaction.

### Layer Components:
1. **Normalization Layer 1 (`self.norm1`)**: Applied before the attention mechanism to stabilize and improve the attention process.
2. **Window Attention (`self.attn`)**: Computes self-attention within local windows, which allows the model to focus on local regions for efficient attention calculation.
3. **Drop Path (`self.drop_path`)**: Implements **stochastic depth** to regularize the model by randomly dropping paths during training.
4. **Normalization Layer 2 (`self.norm2`)**: Applied before the MLP layer for stable learning.
5. **MLP (`mlp`)**: A multi-layer perceptron that processes features after attention, adding further non-linear transformation.
6. **Attention Mask (`self.register_buffer`)**: The attention mask is used during self-attention to control interactions within the windowed input. The shifted window approach facilitates broader context by allowing cross-window interaction.

## Swin Transformer Block’s Forward Pass

In the forward pass of the `SwinTransformerBlock`, there are 4 main steps that allow the model to capture relationships within and across local windows:

1. **Cyclic Shift**: The feature map is partitioned into windows using `window_partition`. A cyclic shift is then applied to the partitions, moving elements (windows) left or right and wrapping around elements that move beyond the boundary back to the other end. This shift allows the model to capture relationships between adjacent windows, enhancing spatial context.
   - **Example**: For a sequence `A, B, C, D`, a cyclic shift to the right by one position results in `D, A, B, C`.

2. **Windowed Attention**: Attention is performed using the **Window-based Multi-Head Self-Attention (W-MSA)** module within each window. This focused attention enables efficient computation by limiting the attention scope to each local window.

3. **Merge Patches**: Patches are merged using the `PatchMerging` layer, reducing spatial resolution while increasing feature dimensions. This downsampling step prepares the features for hierarchical processing.

4. **Reverse Cyclic Shift**: After attention is completed, the window partitioning is undone using `reverse_window`, and the cyclic shift operation is reversed, restoring the feature map to its original spatial arrangement.

## Classification Head
After processing through the transformer blocks, the final features are classified using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head**. This head performs the final classification, outputting probabilities for each class.

## Core Concepts Used in Swin Transformer

### Self-Attention Mechanism
Attention mechanisms let the model focus on important regions of the input when making predictions.

1. **Self-Attention**: In Swin, self-attention helps each patch interact with neighboring patches, capturing local context within each window.

2. **Cross-Attention** (Optional in some tasks): Focuses on relationships between patches and other elements in the dataset.

## Implementation Summary

1. **Define Parameters**: `window_size`, `ape`, and optional hardware optimizations.
2. **Embed Patches**: Use Conv2D to create embeddings for each patch.
3. **Add Positional Embedding**: Absolute position embeddings improve spatial awareness.
4. **Apply Depth Decay**: Skip layers stochastically to regularize and reduce overfitting.
5. **Construct Layers**: Use `SwinTransformerBlock` layers with hierarchical patch merging.
6. **Forward Pass**: Implement the 4 steps:
   - Cyclic Shift
   - Windowed Attention
   - Patch Merging
   - Reverse Cyclic Shift
7. **Classification Head**: Final MLP head outputs class probabilities.
